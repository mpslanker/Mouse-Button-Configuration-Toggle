Mouse-Button-Configuration-Toggle
=================================

Allows you to quickly switch primary and secondary buttons on the mouse with a simple keyboard shortcut.

Currently the shortcut is hard-coded as "Win + ~".  You will see a black and white icon in your systray denoting
which orientation is currently activated.  Pressing the shortcut will prompt a balloon tip to appear notifying you
of the new orientation.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at dev@msitp.com

Currently requires Managed Windows API (http://mwinapi.sourceforge.net/) for Global Hotkey.

Please note. This was thrown together at the request of a friend and although it works, it is very ugly.
I plan on following proper practices and cleaning this up.  So please be kind. :)
