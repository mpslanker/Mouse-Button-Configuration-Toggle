Mouse-Button-Configuration-Toggle
=================================

Allows you to quickly switch primary and secondary buttons on the mouse with a simple keyboard shortcut.

Currently the shortcut is hard-coded as "Win + ~".  You will see a black and white icon in your systray denoting
which orientation is currently activated.  Pressing the shortcut will prompt a balloon tip to appear notifying you
of the new orientation.
